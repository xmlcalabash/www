<important>
<para>These are not the web pages you are looking for. Go to the
<link xlink:href="/">home page</link> and follow the links for XML Calabash 3.x.
Or whatever seems most recent.</para>
<para>These are the archived pages for XML Calabash 1.x. As the release of XML
Calabash 3.0, a complete reimplementation for XProc 3.x, approaches (circa
October, 2024), it becomes less and less likely that there will be any more
updates here.</para>
<para>These pages are preserved out of a sense of obligation to the past. Or something.
I tried to fix all of the links, but I could have missed some.
